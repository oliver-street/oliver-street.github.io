I am a Research Fellow at the [Grantham Institute](https://www.imperial.ac.uk/grantham/), Imperial College London. The main theme of my research is exploring relationships between geometry and mechanics, with a particular focus on stochastic modelling. My work usually involves a class of equations (either deterministic or stochastic) derived from the perspective of geometric mechanics, and my interest within this theme is divided between the methodology through which such equations are derived and the properties of the equations themselves. This work has led to an interest in, and contribution to, scientific topics including: geophysical fluid dynamics, plasma physics, wave-current interaction, free boundary problems, fast/slow dynamical systems, inertial particle motion, and ensemble forecasting methodologies.
