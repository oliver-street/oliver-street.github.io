I am a research associate in the Department of Mathematics at Imperial College London, within the [Stochastic Transport in Upper Ocean Dynamics](https://www.imperial.ac.uk/ocean-dynamics-synergy/) (STUOD) project. My main topics of interest are geometric mechanics, stochastic analysis, and the analysis of problems arising in fluid mechanics. My work involves working with a class of equations (either deterministic or stochastic) derived from the perspective of geometric mechanics, and my interest within this theme is divided between the methodology through which such equations are derived and the properties of the equations themselves. My most recent work within these topics is concerned with free boundary dynamics and wave-current interaction.
